# CompleteBinaryTreeAlgorithms

This program's goal is understand the complexity of greedy,recursive and dynamic programming algorithms. Firstly program creates a random binary tree. Then greedy ,recursive and dynamic programming algorithms work to make complete binary tree. And finally print their working times.
